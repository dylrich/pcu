pcu
----------

pcu uses the new cachestat system call to efficiently report page cache usage
statistics for files on disk. You can point pcu to any filepath and quickly
learn which files have been cached, if any have been recently evicted from the
page cache, or which files are dirty.

Requirements
----------
Your Linux kernel must be version 6.5 or newer, and as of right now this tool
only runs on x86 CPUs. Additionally, special file types like hard or soft links
are almost certainly not handled correctly at the moment.

Build
----------
You can build this tool by running "go build" in the root directory.

Sample Output
----------
$ pcu -format=size -summarize=directory=1 /usr/local/go

Usage
----------
pcu [OPTIONS] [PATH]

Retrieve page cache usage statistics

OPTIONS:
        -h, -help
                Print this message

        -summarize=<METHOD>
                Set the unit of aggregation

                Valid methods include:

                        file
                                All individual files will have their statistics reported

                        directory[=<DEPTH>]
                                Only directories will have their aggregate statistics
                                reported. An optional integer depth parameter can be set
                                that limits reporting to directories above a certain depth.
                                For example, if we're examining a filepath ./abc/123/def/456
                                and we set -summarize=directory=2, only ./abc and ./abc/123
                                will have statistics reported.

                        total
                                Only the total sum of all files at the current path will be
                                reported

        -format=<FORMAT>
                Set the statistics format

                Valid formats include:

                        count

                                All numbers are reported in terms of page count

                        -size

                                All numbers are reported in terms of their size in bytes

        -human-readable
                When format=size, print sizes in easier to read format
